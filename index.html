<p>Hi there :) I am Daehyeon Choi, Undergraduate student in <a href="http://postech.ac.kr">Pohang Institute of Science &amp; Technology</a> (POSTECH), and I am Undergraduate Intern in Visual &amp; Geometric Lab, in Seoul National University. My advisor is Professor <a href="http://jaesik.info">Jaesik Park</a>.</p>


<p>Since a few years ago, I have interested in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, and I started my career by studying Computer Vision. Currently, I am interested in Generative Model, especially Score-Based Models. </p>


<p>And I am dealing with some problems about generative model and its applications, such as text-to-image synthesis, Image Editing, and so on. </p>
